I spent the whole of my short (~1-mile) hike working on my photography skills and figuring out a bunch of things (such as: if you want a sense of depth to a shot of a trail, don’t use a 20mm lens 😅). And then, a third of the way back from my turnaround point, I saw this and said: [huh!][huh] And a bunch of my experiments on the rest of the walk paid off in this shot (mid-day sun notwithstanding).
